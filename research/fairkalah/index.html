      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page presents all known <strong>fair starting positions</strong> by moving 1 or 2 pieces for the 
        Mancala (Kalah) variant <strong>without null capture</strong>. These states are
        not included directly in the paper due to space limitations and are instead
        archived here for transparency, reproducibility, and presentation use.
      </p>

      <p>
        These positions were generated through full-state computational analysis and
        evaluated under the modified rule set where zero-piece captures are disabled.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the analysis of the <strong>standard (usual) version of Mancala</strong>, please refer to the primary FairKalah research page:

        <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
        Kalah (a.k.a. Mancala) is a two-player game of perfect information
    that has been a popular game for over half a century despite a strong first player
    advantage. Previous AI research concerns Kalah with empty captures, yet a common variation disallows empty captures. In this paper, we present the first analysis
    of the fairness of Kalah without empty captures, initial game states that are fair,
    as well as optimal play insights from analysis of optimal and suboptimal states.

      <h2>Fair State Archive</h2>

      <p>
        A total of <strong>251 provably fair starting positions</strong> were identified
        for the <strong>no-null-capture Mancala variant</strong>. Due to space and performance
        constraints, the full set of boards is hosted on a separate archive page.
